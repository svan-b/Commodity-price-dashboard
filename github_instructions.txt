INSTRUCTIONS FOR PUSHING TO GITHUB

I've prepared your repository with all changes committed locally. To push these changes to GitHub, follow these steps:

1. Open a Command Prompt or PowerShell window in Windows

2. Navigate to your project directory:
   cd "C:\Users\vanbo\Commercial and Market Research\Commodity-price-dashboard"

3. Verify everything is ready:
   git status

4. Push the changes to GitHub:
   git push -u origin master

   IMPORTANT: We're using the "master" branch, not "main". Make sure to push to the correct branch.
   
   If this is your first time pushing to the repository, you'll need to authenticate with GitHub.
   GitHub no longer accepts password authentication from the command line.
   
   You can use:
   - GitHub CLI (gh auth login)
   - A personal access token
   - SSH keys
   - Or use GitHub Desktop instead

5. Alternative: Using GitHub Desktop
   If you have GitHub Desktop installed:
   - Open GitHub Desktop
   - Add the local repository (File > Add local repository)
   - Select your repository folder
   - Click "Publish repository" (if it's a new repository) or "Push origin" (if it already exists)

All the code improvements we made have been committed:
1. Enhanced UI with color indicators and SPOT/FUTURES labels
2. Fixed price movement display with proper time references
3. Improved data loading to show all commodities
4. Enhanced API Status tab with detailed validation information
5. Updated README with comprehensive documentation and cloud deployment instructions

Your repository is now ready for deployment to Streamlit Cloud or any other hosting platform.
